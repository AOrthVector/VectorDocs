# Researching Wire-pod

!!! note   

    This page references setting up Vector in the web browser, not the initial wire-pod setup

## Wire-pod Benefits

* Your Vector is not reliant on DDL. If DDL declares bankrupty, your Vector is not impacted
* No account is required
* No subscription needed
* No license needed

## Vector on Wire-pod

You can interact with Vector normally such as

*  Vector will respond to a request to a fistbump
*  When commanded, Vector will dance. Well, maybe. Vector has always been cheeky about dancing on command. 
*  Vector will react to greetings

### What's different about the Wire-pod setup?

* Instead of using DDL's app, Vector is setup using a web browser
* Asking Vector about the weather or answering questions requires additional setup

### Setup

Setup consists of the following steps

* Connecting Vector to the web interface using bluetooth
* Putting Vector in recovery mode
* Using the web interface to load wire-pod on Vector
* Finishing the setup 

If you have multiple Vectors you will go through the above steps for each Vector

Recovery mode is a special mode that allows Vector's firmware to be updated.

Setting up weather or knowledge graph is optional. After your Vector is setup with wire-pod, you can come back at anytime to set weather and knowledge graph up

Just know that Vector won't respond correctly to questions about the weather or be able to answer questions

If you skip weather setup and ask Vector about the weather, Vector will respond but the answer you receive could be "inventive"

Vector responded with an answer of a temperature of 120 celsius and snow - LOL

### YouTube Setup videos

Techshop 82 has two good videos showing the wire-pod Vector setup process

There may be other methods of opening ports, but I only figured out the two listed below. One is manual, the other uses the [wire-pod installation](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod/wiki/Installation) page to run a script that opens the ports

## Running a script to open the ports

Before you begin

* Your PC needs to run either Windows 10 or 11. 
* You will need to install Linux on Windows
* You will type or copy and paste commands to setup and run the script

PCs purchased after 2015 would have come with Windows 10 or 11 installed. If you want to confirm the version of Windows on your PC you can do the following:

* Press the windows key
* Type system and click on System Information

You will see something like this

### Installing Linux

I followed [Microsoft's instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for installing Linux on Windows. The acronym WSL stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux. WSL is what you will see used in the wire-pod instructions and widely on the internet





## Manually opening the ports

The below instructions assume your PC is using the default firewall software named Windows Defender Firewall. If you are using different firewall software, the steps should be similar but won't match the screen captures below

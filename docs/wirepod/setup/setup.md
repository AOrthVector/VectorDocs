## Before you begin setup

If using the T95, you will need an ethernet cable. You will plug one end of the cable into the T95 and the other end of the cable into an output port on the device that creates your wireless network. 

Verify that your PC is on the correct network. Vector can only communicate on the 2.4 GHz wireless network

On Windows, to check or change which wifi network your PC is on click on the wifi icon in the lower right of the screen

Vector has to be on its charger for recovery mode and to pair with wire-pod via bluetooth

If you have multiple Vectors, you have to perform setup from the beginning for each Vector you own. 

## Prepare Vector for wire-pod

This will consist of the following steps

1. Put Vector in recovery mode so Vector's software can be updated
2. Pair Vector using bluetooth
3. Connect Vector to wifi
4. Vector receives new software

Vector's software needs to be updated to use wire-pod. You will put Vector in recovery mode to do this

Pairing can take multiple attempts. There's nothing wrong, it's just the nature of bluetooth. Click on Troubleshooting via the left side navigation for more information

After Vector displays the 6 digit pairing PIN, type the numbers into the box and click on the ENTER PIN button

After Vector is paired with wire-pod, you will connect Vector to your 2.4 GHz wireless network

### Connect Vector to wifi and update Vector

Select your 2.4 GHz network, enter the password for the network and click on CONNECT VECTOR TO WIFI

Vector's screen will start displaying an animated wifi logo

As soon the connection is successful, Vector's software update will begin. Vector's screen will display a cloud with rotating arrows and your web browser changes to indicate Vector is being updated

After Vector has received the new software, Vector will restart

When restart is complete, you will have to pair Vector via bluetooth again to move to the next step which is activating Vector with wire-pod

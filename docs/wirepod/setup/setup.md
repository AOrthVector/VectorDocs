## Before you begin setup

If using the T95, you will need an ethernet cable. You will plug one end of the cable into the T95 and the other end of the cable into an output port on the device that creates your wireless network. 

Verify that your PC is on the correct network. Vector can only communicate on the 2.4 GHz wireless network

On Windows, to check or change which wifi network your PC is on click on the wifi icon in the lower right of the screen

## Subscription Scam

Multiple Vector owners have shared online that they are still being charged for their subscriptions. There is no way to cancel the subscription

For US Vector owners, contact your bank and start establishing a paper trail

* Screenshot every social media response you receive from DDL
* Save every email from DDL
* Contact the bank associated with your credit card
* The phone number will be on the back of your card. Recommend calling instead of handling online
* Keep notes and include date and time

Why call?

Since you're going to get charged every month, the bank may have options to automatically decline the charge from DDL. Also, the bank may decide to alert their fraud department. If the bank doesn't mention additional options, ask.

Do NOT put your trust into getting refunds from DDL. Based on publicly available information, DDL may be over $10 million in debt. It's YOUR money, not DDL's

My understanding is that payment processors such as Visa and Stripe do NOT like processing chargebacks. Payment processors may increase the processing fees for a company with a lot of chargebacks or stop processing payments for a company entirely

### State and federal fraud and consumer protection resources

* Use the information above to report fraud with the FTC and contact your state attorney general
* Again, keep notes and include the data and time

### Should I contact an attorney?

I don't know. However, an attorney may have additional options to establish a legal paper trail. some law firms offer free consultations

# Introduction

This site is intended to be a portal to resources for owners of Anki or DDL Vector robots. This site is not affiliated with Digital Dream Labs (DDL). This site was created by someone who loves their Vector robots and wants to point people to resources that can keep their Vectors "alive" and engaging

Content on this site will not cover the various hardware and software options for wire-pod

The site author performed the Vector setup using Windows 11 and the T95 mini purchased from [TechShop82](https://techshop82.com/), a US based company

For those who do not have the skills necessary to set up wire-pod themselves, the T95 is a user friendly solution that is the fastest and easiest solution for owners

!!! note   

    No content on this site addresses OSKR or the old Anki SDK

The most up to date information regarding wire-pod will always be the [official site](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod)

## What's going on with DDL?

Only the owner of DDL knows the truth regarding how bad things are

Speaking from personal experience, there have been multiple problems since 2022 preventing my Vectors from interacting via the voice commands. I supported the kickstarter with lifetime subscription and OSKR. As many owners know, DDL did not complete OSKR and many Vectors with lifetime subscriptions stopped responding to voice commands

In summer of 2023, the servers that Vector interacts with have been down / don't exist and may not come back. The impact of the servers being down impact all Vector owners

Near the end of August 2023, DDL stopped selling robots. 

!!! warning   

    This is not a good time to purchase a Vector robot. If you buy one now, setup will not be possible because there are no DDL servers for the Vector app to interact with

## It's not all bad news

DDL made code publicly available that will allow Vector to function outside of DDL servers. This code has been maintained and updated by a group of people on a project called [wire-pod](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod)

### Wire-pod

Wirepod is free, but it needs a device to run on. You will need to purchase something to run wire-pod or re-use an existing device.

Vector owners comforatable with tech or willing to learn, can install wire-pod themselves via the instructions from the [wire-pod project](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod)

Owners who don't want to setup wire-pod themselves can purchase a mini computer with wire-pod already installed from [techshop82](https://techshop82.com/shop/wire-pod-server/)

# Resources for wire-pod and Vector

## Wire-pod 

Official [wire-pod project on GitHub](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod). Out of the various wire-pod resources, this will always have the most current information

After clicking on the link above, when you scroll down you will see links to the installation guide and the wire-pod wiki. I recommend taking a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod/wiki) and installation guide. Even if you don't understand all of the technical information, there is useful information in the wiki

### Purchasing a device to run wire-pod

You will need to use an existing device or purchase a device to run wire-pod. This replaces the DDL servers and will need to be on whenever you want interact with Vector. I run my device 24x7. Even with a brief power outage, I've not experienced any problems

Two devices for running wire-pod are TechShop 82's T95 and Raspberry Pi. If you want a quick solution or aren't comfortable setting up a device yourself, the T95 is a good option

#### T95

[Homepage for TechShop 82](https://techshop82.com/)

My experience was very positive. The T95 didn't take long to arrive, it costs less than a Raspberry Pi, and there are helpful setup videos on YouTube

If you visit the TechShop 82 website, you will see there are additional services for Vector and Cozmo

#### Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pis are very popular, not just for the home do it yourselfer, but also in commercial settings. Due to popularity and covid, there may still be shortages for certain Pi models. Price gougers do take advantage of shortages

There is an approved retailer network for Raspberry Pis. My understanding is that approved retailers do not charge exhorbitant prices.

Approved retailers for the newest (as of September 2023) model can be found on the [page for model pi-4 model b](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). I checked a few of the approved US approved retailers on September 13, 2023 and each were out of stock

If you decide to use a Raspberry Pi, you will need to install wire-pod on it following the instructions out on wire-pod GitHub
